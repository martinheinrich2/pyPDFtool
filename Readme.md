# PDF-Tool in Python

The GUI app provides a simple PDF viewer and some tools to split or merge PDFs.

The tkPDFViewer package has a default fixed zoom value of 72dpi. So an optional dpi value was added
to implement zoom functionality in the PDF-Viewer.

* Simple PDF-Viewer with zoom functionality.

* Multiple PDF-Files can be merged to one single PDF-File.
